# Vanipass 2

## Stream overlay for H3.GG

The overlay that exists right now is made with WPF, XAML and C#, deployed as an unsigned executable and looking generally sus. The version two of the overlay is now in development.
Do mind the development will be slow, as the author is just about learning GO and HTMX (subject to change) that will be used for managing state of the app.

## What to expect

The new overlay aims to achieve the following stuff:
* Deployed as local website, usable on any browser
* Easy to grab from Github for stream hosts
* Easy to transfer ownership if someone from the community would like to carry on the work
* Complete rewrite comes with an opportunity to rethink and redesign the layout and graphics
